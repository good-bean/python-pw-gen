# Python Password Generator
Password generator based on my Java version, but slightly improved with the ability to provide at least two numerals and two special characters, at the minimum.

## Some background
This project was something I've been thinking about for a bit and I wanted to see if I can apply what I have learned about Python to converting my Java program to Python with some added complexity. It's nothing to write home about, but it's fun to try new things :)
